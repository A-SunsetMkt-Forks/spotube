Spotube is a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) based lightweight spotify client. It utilizes the power of Spotify & Youtube's public API & creates a hazardless, performant & resource friendly User Experience
![Application Screenshot](assets/spotube-screenshot.png)

## Features

Following are the features that currently spotube offers:

- Open Source
- No telementry, diagnostics or user data collection
- Lightweight & resource friendly
- Near native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
- Playback control is on user's machine instead of server based
- Small size & less data hungry
- No spotify or youtube ads since it uses all public & free APIs (But it's recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists youtube channel or add as favourite track in spotify. Mostly buying spotify premium is the best way to support their valuable creations)
- Lyrics
- Downloadable track (WIP)

## Requirements (Linuxüêß only)

Don't worry **spotify premium isn't required**üò±. But some extra packages are required.

- [MPV](https://mpv.io/installation/) player for playing the actual audio
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for streaming the audio from youtube

Now, Install youtube-dl from

- official github repo: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation (recommended)
