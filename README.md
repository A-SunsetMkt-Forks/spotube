# Spotube
Spotube is a [qt](https://qt.io) based lightweight spotify client which uses [nodegui/react-nodegui](https://github.com/nodegui/react-nodegui) as frontend & nodejs as backend. It utilizes the power of Spotify & Youtube's public API & creates a hazardless, performant & resource friendly User Experience

## Features
Following are the features that currently spotube offers:
- Open Source
- No telementry, diagnostics or user data collection
- Lightweight & resource friendly
- Near native performance & seemless with default desktop themes (Win10, Win7, OSX, QT-default)
- Playback control is on user's machine instead of server based
- Small size & less data hungry
- No spotify or youtube ads since it uses all public & free APIs (But it's recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists youtube channel or add as favourite track in spotify. Mostly buying spotify premium is the best way to support their valuable creations)

## Installation
I'm always releasing newer versions of binary of the software each 2-3 month with minor changes & each 6-8 month with major changes. Grab the binaries

Windows: [.exe]()

OSX: **I hate apple** (Just kidding, actually don't have a mac)

## Configuration
