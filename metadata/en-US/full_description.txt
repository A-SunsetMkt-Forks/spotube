Features:
* Open Source
* Anonymous/Guest Login
* Cross platform
* No telemetry, diagnostics or user data collection
* Lightweight & resource friendly
* Native performance (Thanks to Flutter+Skia)
* Playback control is on user's machine instead of server based
* Small size & less data hungry
* No spotify or youtube ads since it uses all public & free APIs (But it's recommended to support the creators by watching/liking/subscribing to the artists youtube channel or add as favourite track in spotify. Mostly buying spotify premium is the best way to support their valuable creations)

* Downloadable track
